			<p>The Forge Domain includes deities of craftsmen, smithies, and the crafting of physical items. Deities of this domain are patrons of artisans who work with metal, leather, and stone. A cleric of the Forge Domain is seen as a skilled craftsman in their own right. The most solemn is the dedication of new tools, the blessing of a new building or bridge, or the creation of a new magic item.</p>
