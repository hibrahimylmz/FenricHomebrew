			<p>You briefly speed up or slow time for a creature (other than you) of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect. Otherwise, choose one of the following effects:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Hurry:</strong> The creature is moved to an initiative slot of your choice that more closely follows your current turn and has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Delay:</strong> The creature is moved to an initiative slot of your choice that more distantly follows your current turn and has disadvantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.</p>
